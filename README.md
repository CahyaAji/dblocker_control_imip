## Notes

### 1. Start docker
```
sudo systemctl start docker
```

```
docker compose up -d
```
up: Tells Docker to read the YML file, set up the network, and start all the containers listed inside.

-d: Stands for "detached mode." This runs the containers in the background so you get your terminal prompt back immediately.
